+ Added support for detecting build number of Windows 10 TH2 "November Update".
+ Added new TPJOSInfo.ServicePackEx method that reports any OS service packs present just like TPJOSInfo.ServicePack but also returns the name of any significant, detectable, update that does not declare itself as a service pack. This method was added to enable Windows 10 TH2 "November Update" to be reported since it does not report itself as a service pack.
+ Changed behaviour of the TPJOSInfo.BuildNumber method. When not using the GetVersionEx API the code tries to deduce the build number from other information. If this fails BuildNumber now returns 0 instead of attempting to read the build number from the registry. The registry was found to be returning incorrect build numbers.
+ Updated read-me file re changes.

+ Added new TPJOSInfo.IsReallyWindows10OrGreater method.
+ Changed so that Windows 8, in addition to Windows 8.1 and now Windows 10 can't be "spoofed". This was required so that Windows 8 will be reported when an un-manifested application is running on Windows 10, per Microsoft documentation. This is a breaking change from release 5.0.x.
+ Updated demo programs re support for detecting Windows 10 and to display result of new TPJOSInfo.IsReallyWindows10OrGreater method. Also added Windows 10 compatible manifest to each demo's resources.
+ Updated documentation re changes.

+ Fixed issue #29 (http://bit.ly/1eeLnxC) "Out of range error" that occurred when using Windows 8.1 or Windows Server 2012 R2.
+ Added support for DEBUG symbol to force range checking to be on for debugging purposes.
+ Minor changes to documentation.

Release v5.0.0 of 27 February 2014
+ Changed how operating system information is obtained and reported when running on Windows 8.1 (and later) in order to conform to API changes introduced by Microsoft in Windows 8.1. As a consequence when running on Windows 8.1 and later OS information for the installed OS will always be reported regardless of whether the host program is running in compatibility. On Windows 8 and earlier running in a compatibility mode will continue to cause OS information to be "spoofed" to reflect the emulated OS.
+ New compile option to help debug the Windows 8.1 method of OS information when using any OS back to Windows Vista.
+ Added new TPJOSInfo.CanSpoof method that indicates if compatibility mode will affect (spoof) reported OS information on the current operating system.
+ Windows 8.1 and Windows 2012 Server R2 are now detected and reported.
+ Windows XP Home Edition is now detected correctly.
+ Numerous new methods added to TPJOSInfo that can detect if the current OS is greater than or equal to a given OS. These methods are not affected by compatibility mode regardless of the compile option used. There is one method for every OS version and service pack from Windows 2000 onwards.
+ New TPJOSInfo.IsWindowsServer method that detects if the OS is a server in a manner not affected by compatibility mode for Windows 2000 and later.
+ New TPJOSInfo.InstallationDate method that returns the date the OS is installed.
+ New global variables added that are analogues of the SysUtils Win32*** variables but that are not affected by compatibility mode when run on Windows 8.1 or later.
+ New constants relating to obtaining version information not defined by all supported versions of Delphi have been added to the unit's interface section.
+ Updated demos:
  - Both VCL and FireMonkey 2 demos revised to display output of all new TPJOSInfo methods and new global variables.
  - VCL demo no longer scrolls when displaying lists of information that exceed window height.
+ Delphi 3 is no longer supported by the unit.
